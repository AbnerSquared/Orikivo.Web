                Orikivo is a personal project that originally started as a joke. However, due to my lack of self-control, it has expanded to an ever so thriving system that aims to become a fully dynamic adventure that anyone is free to partake in.

                Feel free to talk to them at any point in time, as they don't bite! <b>(from what I remember)</b>
                If something feels out of your style, Orikivo is built by your standards. With over 50 detailed options, Orikivo can
                follow suit by any standards you give it. Block bad words, sites, change how Orikivo shows results, control pixel art rendering,
                and much more.

                <div id="paragraph">Orikivo is made by one person. As many know, when development goes this route, there tends
                    to be a mess of underlying bugs and problems that may occur from time to time. Alongside this, there may be commands that could
                    have much easier time working with a couple of changes. This is where the suggestions and report tab falls into play. In the case of you running 
                    into a runtime error, or have buggy situations, you are all free to report the bug, from which will be verified/tracked. On the off hand, you can
                    also offer suggestions with how the bot should work specific things, and improvements toward anything else. We all ride together, and it will be worthwhile to those
                    that chip in.

                dungeon toolkits*, data management*, moderation*, and more lay foot in your disposal.

                    Orikivo is designed from the ground up in a pixel art style format.
                    If that's your kind of style, you'll enjoy what this bot has to offer!
                    Orikivo focuses entirely on dynamic pixel spritesheets, which allow for fancy font faces,
                    alongside a world of color in an era that seems pretty dim. If certain elements don't follow through with
                    you, you're always free to stick with Orikivo 1.00. :)
